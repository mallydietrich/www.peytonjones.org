# Hi Simon! Welcome to your website how-to guide!

This folder includes many different files to guide you through making changes to your website. Here is a description of the content each file includes:


## [_templates](https://github.com/simonpj/www.peytonjones.org/tree/gh-pages/_documentation/_templates)

This folder contains the different page templates available. We created these templates to ensure consistency across the website. Each template has comments to help you format the pages and include the relevant front matter. The following templates are available: 

- pubs.md
- refined-page.md
- simple-page.md

More information on how to use templates can be found in the [Template Documentation (How-to-Use-Templates.md)](https://github.com/simonpj/www.peytonjones.org/blob/gh-pages/_documentation/How-to-Use-Templates.md) documentation.


## [Add-New-Page.md](https://github.com/simonpj/www.peytonjones.org/blob/gh-pages/_documentation/Add-New-Page.md)

Website pages hold different forms of content. On your website, pages include content such as the Research talks and videos, as well as landing pages for posts, in the case of the Haskell page. While there are currently no plans to add new pages to the website, if there eventually becomes a need to add more content, here are some instructions on how to create a new page.


## [Add-New-Publication.md](https://github.com/simonpj/www.peytonjones.org/blob/gh-pages/_documentation/Add-New-Publication.md)

Publication pages are the individual landing pages that include information about a publication, as well as the option to download the PDF of the publication or BibTex. This document provides information around how to add a new publication page (technically, a post), or how to add content, such as a new video, to a publication page.


## [Add-New-Research-Skill-Page.md](https://github.com/simonpj/www.peytonjones.org/blob/gh-pages/_documentation/Add-New-Research-Skill-Page.md)

Research Skills pages include “How to Write a Great Research Paper,” "How to Give a Great Research Talk," and “How to Write a Great Grant Proposal.” These pages include a table of contents, and use either the simple or refined page template. This document describes how to add another one of these pages.


## [Change-Front-Matter.md](https://github.com/simonpj/www.peytonjones.org/blob/gh-pages/_documentation/Change-Front-Matter.md)

On each page and each post on the website, there is some front matter that impacts formatting of the page, such as the layout, the header, and more.  


## [How-to-Use-Templates.md](https://github.com/simonpj/www.peytonjones.org/blob/gh-pages/_documentation/How-to-Use-Templates.md)

This document describes how to copy, paste, and use the page templates created.


## [Tips-and-Tricks.md](https://github.com/simonpj/www.peytonjones.org/blob/gh-pages/_documentation/Tips-and-Tricks.md)

This document provides an overview of other helpful information that doesn’t quite fit in the other documents.


## [Update-Author-Profile.md](https://github.com/simonpj/www.peytonjones.org/blob/gh-pages/_documentation/Update-Author-Profile.md)

The author profile is located on the left hand side of many of the webpages. It includes an image, your name (Simon Peyton Jones), a title, location, and social media and contact links. This document details how to make changes to the different parts of your profile, such as changing an email or social link, or updating your image and title.


## [Update-Home-Page.md](https://github.com/simonpj/www.peytonjones.org/blob/gh-pages/_documentation/Update-Home-Page.md)

Your home or landing page is the first space people see when they come to your website. Currently, your home page includes other pieces of content already mentioned (such as your author profile and Research Skills pages). This document details how to make changes to your homepage content, which is similar to making changes to other pages on your website. 


## [Update-Pages.md](https://github.com/simonpj/www.peytonjones.org/blob/gh-pages/_documentation/Update-Pages.md)

This document describes how to make changes to most pages on your website. While similar to adding a new page, this document provides more detail on changing or adding other forms of multimedia, such as images (within a gallery) or videos.


## [Update-Site-Navigation.md](https://github.com/simonpj/www.peytonjones.org/blob/gh-pages/_documentation/Update-Site-Navigation.md)

After adding a new page to the website, you will need to update the website’s navigation or menu bar. This document illustrates how to make these changes.
