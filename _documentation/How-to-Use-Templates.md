The **_templates** folder located is located within the **_documentation** folder. Within **_templates** folder, there are a few different templates available for your use:

- **pubs.md** - A **publication** page template used for all of the publication posts. This template is used for publications both with a video as well as without a video. To learn more about how to embed content into the post, review the document [Update-Pages.md](https://github.com/simonpj/www.peytonjones.org/blob/gh-pages/_documentation/Update-Pages.md).
- **simple-page.md** - A **simple page** template is used for new website pages that only include written content (text) and links to other webpages. This template can be easily formatted in Markdown. 
- **refined-page.md** - A **refined page** template is used for new website pages that includes both this text and these links, but also can include things such as images or videos. 

Determine which template you will need for the new page. Using these templates ensures all of the correct information, especially front matter, is included in the correct order on the page. Copy the template.

    Tip: You can quick copy the template but clicking **Copy Raw Contents** next to **Edit** on the Markdown file.
