This document provides an overview of other helpful information that doesn’t quite fit in the other documents.

## What This Document Includes

- Describes what a short link is
- Information about the available website layouts


# Short Links

Short links are a shortened version of a page’s URL. Rather than including all of a page’s URL (such as http, the domain name, etc), you can use a shortened version of the URL or permalink within your website’s navigation.

For example, a [short link](https://github.com/simonpj/www.peytonjones.org/blob/gh-pages/_documentation/Tips-and-Tricks.md) is **/assets/bibtext/<bibfile>.bib** rather than www.peytonjones.com/assets/bibtext/<bibfile>.bib


# About Layouts

A page layout is a theme-related piece of front matter. The layout determines how the page will be generally structured. 

In many of the templates and pages, *layout*, is commented out. On some other pages, the *layout* is set to single or wide. 

To view more documentation around layouts and what is available with the website’s theme (Minimal Mistakes), view the [Minimal Mistakes documentation on layouts](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/layouts/).
