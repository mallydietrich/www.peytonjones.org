# Introduction
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) is an advanced, purely functional programming language. In particular, it is a [polymorphically statically typed, lazy, purely functional language,](https://www.haskell.org/definition/) quite different from most other programming languages. The language is named for Haskell Brooks Curry, whose work in mathematical logic serves as a foundation for functional languages. Haskell is based on the lambda calculus, hence the lambda we use as a logo.
