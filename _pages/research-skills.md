# Other great resources on research skills

Here are some pointers to some other excellent resources on research skills, made by other people.

* [You and your research](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html), Hamming’s famous 1986 talk on how to do great research.
* [The Navigators Research Book of Style](https://navigators.di.fc.ul.pt/wiki/The_Navigators_Research_Book_of_Style) is a slide deck from the Navigators research group at the University of Lisbon. It covers choosing a research topic, doing research, and writing and submitting a paper.
* [Research tips](http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/~silvia/research-tips/) (including how to do research, how to write and present a paper, how to design a poster, how to review, etc), by Sylvia Miksch
* [Notes on presenting theses](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/teach/theses.pdf), edited by Aaron Sloman, gives useful guidelines and ideas for PhD students writing their thesis.
* [Chris O’Leary’s essays about writing an “elevator pitch”](http://www.elevatorpitchessentials.com/). This stuff, especially the list of attributes in the “Elevator pitch 101” page, is very relevant to writing a good grant proposal.
* [Guide for preparation and publication of abstracts](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/write-great-research-paper/other-resources/href=) and [A scrutiny of the abstract](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2016/06/scrutiny.pdf), both by Kenneth Landes in Geological Notes. These short notes give guidance about writing the abstract of your paper.
* Norman Ramsey’s notes about his [class on Technical Writing](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/pubs/two-abstract.html).
* [Mathematical Writing](http://tex.loria.fr/typographie/mathwriting.pdf), by Donald E. Knuth et al. The first three sections constitute a minicourse on technical writing: only eight pages long. The time to read it will repay itself many times over.
* [How to Write Mathematics](http://www.stat.rice.edu/~riedi/Halmos.html), by PR Halmos.
* Gian-Carlo Rota’s excellent talk [Ten lessons I wish I had been taught](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~cahn/life/gian-carlo-rota-10-lessons.html), which, among other things, has a bit to say about giving a talk.
* David Patterson’s talk How to have a bad career in research/academia has many wise things to say on a related topic.
* [Mark Leone’s page](http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mleone/web/how-to.html) has a good collection of links to other resources.
* Papers about measurement:
  * [Producing wrong data without doing anything obviously wrong!](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1508244.1508275) Mytkowicz, Diwan, Hauswirth and Sweeney, ASPLOS 2009.
  * [How not to lie with statistics – the correct way to summarise benchmark results](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=5666.5673&coll=GUIDE&dl=GUIDE&CFID=106744944&CFTOKEN=90490737) Fleming & Wallace, CACM 29(3), pp218-221, March 1986.
* Derek Dreyer’s excellent PLMW’16 talk “How to write papers so that people can read them” ([slides here](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1508244.1508275), [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PM1Atui30qU)) tackles exactly the same question as my talk, and also offers seven concrete suggestions — and they are interestingly different from mine!
* The [blog post](https://igorpak.wordpress.com/2017/07/12/how-to-write-math-papers-clearly/) by Igor Pak on ‘How to write math papers clearly’ is also useful.
