# Introduction

Writing papers and giving talks are key skills for any researcher, but they aren’t easy. In this presentation, I’ll describe simple guidelines that I follow for giving talks, which I think may be useful to you too. I don’t have all the answers—far from it! Please also see my talks on [how to write a great research paper](../great-research-paper/) and [how to write a great research proposal](../great-grant-proposal/).
