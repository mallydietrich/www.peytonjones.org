  Functional logic languages have a rich literature, but it is tricky
  to give them a satisfying semantics.  In this paper we describe the
  Verse calculus, VC, a new core calculus for functional
  logical programming. Our main contribution is to equip VC with a
  small-step rewrite semantics, so that we can reason
  about a VC program in the same way as one does with lambda
  calculus; that is, by applying successive rewrites to it.

*The final version of this paper will appear at the International Conference on Functional Programming 2023*

*We are eager to enagage in a dialogue with the community.  Please do write to us.*
